<h1 style="text-align:center; color: #5a7e8c">FOOD DECIDER</h1>
<p>
Application was created during course of Kotlin.<br/>
In this course users allowed adding food to the list. After that users can randomly food/restaurant by click to button. The disadvantage of this app was that after turn off that, users losted his saving items.<br/>
Idea of this app appeal me and I decide to improve this app. Now this app are much more user friendly.<br/>
